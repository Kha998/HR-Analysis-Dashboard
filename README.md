# HR Analytics Dashboard – Attrition, Demographics, Salary & Performance

This project presents an **interactive HR analytics dashboard built using Power BI** to analyze employee attrition, workforce demographics, and salary–performance alignment. The goal is to support **data-driven HR decision-making** by identifying retention risks, understanding workforce composition, and evaluating compensation effectiveness.

## Project Objective
To develop a comprehensive HR analytics solution that helps organizations:
- Identify high-risk departments and job roles for attrition  
- Understand workforce demographic patterns  
- Assess whether compensation aligns with employee performance  



## Project Overview
The analysis is based on **1,470 employee records** and is delivered through **three integrated Power BI dashboards**, supported by insight and recommendation pages:

- **Attrition Analysis Dashboard**  
  Analyzes attrition rate, turnover trends, high-risk departments and job roles, and key drivers such as overtime and job satisfaction.

- **Employee Demographic Analysis Dashboard**  
  Examines workforce distribution by age, gender, tenure, department, experience, and business travel.

- **Salary & Performance Analysis Dashboard**  
  Evaluates salary distribution, performance ratings, high-performer proportion, and pay–performance alignment.
